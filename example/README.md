# Examples

> [!TIP]
> Try out `unidep` in this folder by running:
> - `unidep install ./setup_py_project ./hatch_project` to install the `setup_py_project` and `hatch_project` packages with `conda` and the rest of the dependencies with `pip`
> - `unidep install-all -e` to install all packages (`setup_py_project`, `hatch_project`, and `setuptools_project`) in editable mode
> - `unidep conda-lock` to generate a global `conda-lock.yml` file and consistent per package `conda-lock.yml` files
> - `unidep merge` to merge all `requirements.yaml` files into a single `environment.yaml` file
> - `unidep pip-compile` to generate a locked `requirements.txt` file

Check the folders in this directory for examples of how to use `unidep` with different project types:

- [`setup_py_project` for a `setup.py` integration example](setup_py_project/)
- [`pyproject_toml_project` for a `pyproject.toml` with Setuptools example](pyproject_toml_project/)
- [`hatch_project` for Hatchling project example](hatch_project)

## Combine one or multiple `requirements.yaml` files into a single `environment.yaml` file

Combine `requirements.yaml` files in subdirectories and into an `environment.yaml` file that can be installed with `conda`.

Here we can just run `unidep merge` with no arguments, since the defaults are the same as what we want.

This would be the same as running `unidep merge --name myenv --verbose`:

<!-- echo '```bash' -->
<!-- unidep merge --name myenv --verbose -->

## Install a package using `requirements.yaml` file directly with `pip`

Install a `requirements.yaml` file directly with pip, which installs only the pip installable packages and then the local project itself.

Just run `pip install ./setup_py_project/`.

Because `unidep` is in the `[build-system]` section of [the `pyproject.toml` file](setup_py_project/pyproject.toml), it will be installed automatically.

## Install a `requirements.yaml` file directly with `unidep`

Install a `requirements.yaml` file directly with `unidep`, which first installs the conda installable packages, then the Pip installable packages, and finally the local package itself.

Just run `unidep install ./setup_py_project` or `unidep install -e ./setup_py_project` for an editable install.

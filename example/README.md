> - `unidep install-all -e` to install all packages (`setup_py_project`, `hatch_project`, and `setuptools_project`) in editable mode
> - `unidep conda-lock` to generate a global `conda-lock.yml` file and consistent per package `conda-lock.yml` files
> - `unidep merge` to merge all `requirements.yaml` files into a single `environment.yaml` file
> - `unidep pip-compile` to generate a locked `requirements.txt` file

Check the installable Python packages in this directory for examples of how to use `unidep` with different project types:

- [`setup_py_project`](setup_py_project): for a `setup.py` integration example with a `requirements.yaml` file
- [`setuptools_project`](setuptools_project): for a `pyproject.toml` with Setuptools example with a `requirements.yaml` file
- [`pyproject_toml_project`](pyproject_toml_project): for a `pyproject.toml` with Setuptools example where all dependencies are also specified in `pyproject.toml`
- [`hatch_project`](hatch_project): for Hatchling project example with a `requirements.yaml` file

### Combine one or multiple `requirements.yaml` files into a single `environment.yaml` file

Combine `requirements.yaml` files in subdirectories and into an `environment.yaml` file that can be installed with `conda`.

Here we can just run `unidep merge` with no arguments, since the defaults are the same as what we want.

This would be the same as running `unidep merge --name myenv --verbose`:

See the resulting [`environment.yaml`](environment.yaml) file which is installable with [`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
This file is using `sel(linux|osx|win)` to specify platform specific dependencies.
Alternatively, use `unidep merge --selector comment` to generate a file that uses comments to specify platform specific dependencies, which can be read by [`conda-lock`](https://github.com/conda/conda-lock).

### Using `pip install` with a `requirements.yaml` file

This method allows you to install packages defined in a `requirements.yaml` file using `pip`. It focuses on installing only those dependencies that are pip-installable, followed by the local project package.

**How to Use**:

- Run `pip install ./setup_py_project`.
- This command will process the `requirements.yaml` in the specified directory (`./setup_py_project/`), installing all pip-installable dependencies, including the local project itself.

### Using `unidep install` with a `requirements.yaml` file

Using `unidep` for installation offers a more comprehensive approach. It handles both Conda and Pip dependencies specified in the `requirements.yaml` file, ensuring all necessary packages are installed, including those not available through pip.

**How to Use**:

- To perform a standard installation, run `unidep install ./setup_py_project`.
- For an editable installation (useful during development), use `unidep install -e ./setup_py_project`.
- The `unidep install` command first installs any Conda-specific dependencies from the `requirements.yaml` file, then proceeds to install pip-specific dependencies. Finally, it installs the local project package.

### Using `unidep install-all` for installation across multiple projects

The `unidep install-all` command provides a convenient way to install all dependencies across multiple projects or packages within a given directory.
This command is especially useful in monorepos or when managing several related projects with their own `requirements.yaml` files.

**How `unidep install-all` Works**:

- This command scans a specified directory (or the current directory if none is specified) for `requirements.yaml` files.
- It then installs dependencies for each found project, handling both Conda and Pip dependencies.
- The local packages are also installed, making this command a one-stop solution for setting up your entire workspace.

**Usage Examples**:

- Run `unidep install-all` to install all dependencies in the current directory.
- Use `unidep install-all -e` for an editable install, which is useful during development. This flag ensures that local packages are installed in a way that allows changes to be reflected immediately without needing reinstallation.

**Example Command**:

```bash
# To install all projects in the current directory in editable mode
unidep install-all -e
```

**Output Example**:

<!-- CODE:BASH:START -->
<!-- echo '```bash' -->
<!-- echo '$ unidep install-all -e --dry-run' -->
<!-- unidep install-all -e --dry-run -->
<!-- echo '```' -->

This command streamlines the process of getting a development environment up and running, particularly in complex setups with multiple interdependent projects.

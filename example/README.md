# Example

Run `requirements.yaml` files in subdirectories and combine them into an `environment.yaml` file.

Here we can just run `unidep merge` with no arguments, since the defaults are the same as what we want.

This would be the same as running `unidep merge --name myenv --verbose`:

<!-- CODE:BASH:START -->
<!-- echo '```bash' -->
<!-- unidep merge --name myenv --verbose -->
<!-- echo '```' -->
<!-- CODE:END -->
<!-- OUTPUT:START -->

## Combine one or multiple `requirements.yaml` files into a single `environment.yaml` file

Combine `requirements.yaml` files in subdirectories and into an `environment.yaml` file that can be installed with `conda`.

Here we can just run `unidep merge` with no arguments, since the defaults are the same as what we want.

This would be the same as running `unidep merge --name myenv --verbose`:

## Install a `requirements.yaml` file directly with pip

Install a `requirements.yaml` file directly with pip, which installs only the Pip installable packages.

Just run `pip install ./project1/`.

## Install a `requirements.yaml` file directly with `unidep`

Install a `requirements.yaml` file directly with `unidep`, which first installs the conda installable packages, then the Pip installable packages, and finally the local package itself.

Just run `unidep install ./project1` or `unidep install -e ./project1` for an editable install.

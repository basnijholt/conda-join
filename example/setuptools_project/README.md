# Setuptools `pyproject.toml` integration example

> [!TIP]
> - **Standard Installation**: In this example folder, use `pip install .` to install all Python dependencies that are pip-installable, along with the local package itself.
> - **Comprehensive Installation with `unidep`**: To install all dependencies, including those that are not Python-specific, use `unidep install .`. This command performs the following actions in sequence:
>  1. `conda install [dependencies from requirements.yaml]` â€“ Installs Conda-specific dependencies.
>  2. `pip install [dependencies from requirements.yaml]` â€“ Installs pip-specific dependencies.
>  3. `pip install .` â€“ Installs the local package.

For projects using `setuptools` with only a `pyproject.toml` file, configure `unidep` in `pyproject.toml` alongside a `requirements.yaml` file.

**Example Configuration for projects using `pyproject.toml`**:

Add this to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[build-system]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
requires = ["setuptools", "unidep[yaml]"]  # add "unidep" here

[project]
dynamic = ["dependencies"]  # add "dependencies" here
```

Then, of course, add a `requirements.yaml` and you are good to go! ðŸŽ‰

> [!NOTE]
> See the [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) for a working example.
